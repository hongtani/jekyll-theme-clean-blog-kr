## Are there any Korean restaurants in your country? ##


![rose](/img/posts/koreafood1/rose_tteok.jpeg)

If there is a Korean restaurant in your country, it would be Korean food that Koreans don't eat.
So many Koreans are sad that you might not experience real Korean food. What's the big deal you don't know about food? Because Koreans are very serious about food. We call ourselves the people of Mukbo(A person who likes to eat and enjoys).


### I know what you know about Korean food ###

You know bulgogi, bibimbap, kimchi, etc., right?
There is no Korean who hasn't tried that food. But how many times a Korean eats bibimbap a year?
Maybe more than half of the people don't eat even once.
But that doesn't mean bibimbap is a bad food. It's just that it's not the food that Koreans eat and like the most these days.
Koreans love eating so much that they enjoy a culture where new menus appear every year and become popular. Every day, on the Internet, the results of the challenge of adding new recipes to traditional Korean food are posted. As many failures have occurred, interesting phenomena occur, with Koreans taking on nationwide challenges for a while on menus that have perfected their taste. I would like to introduce interesting foods created through this process.



## You may have heard of a food called tteokbokki ##

Tteokbokki is the favorite food of Koreans. It's just that it's not something you eat every day like a meal. It's like a light-hearted fast food that you can eat with your friends once or twice a week. Most people usually eat it to taste spicy, but these days, various flavors of tteokbokki are popular. In particular, tteokbokki with rose sauce is a big trend among young Koreans. Yes, it's the same rosé sauce you know of rose pasta. The soft cream and spicy taste of tteokbokki go really well together.
The most famous brand for this rosé tteokbokki is a brand called "Baetteok."
Unfortunately, "Baetteok" is a brand specializing in delivery and cannot visit the store.
If you have a plan to visit Korea, please ask the staff of your accommodation. They'll be very happy to order the food for you. Because they are also Koreans who are the people of Mukbo.


## Not waffles, Not croissants, it’s Croffles ##

I'm sure everyone knows what Belgian waffles look like and taste like. And croissants are also popular all over the world.
In korea, dessert made by putting croissant batter in Belgian waffle maker is all the rage. The croissant dough with a crispy texture meets the waffle maker and gives it a really great taste. I don't think you need to come all the way to Korea to eat this. It would be nice to know that this kind of dessert is popular in Korea.


### Icecream(?) that Koreans love the most ###

Technically, this is not ice cream. This is because it is a powder of pure ice without cream. Surprisingly, this cool dessert is being developed every summer according to the needs of Koreans.
Recently it was made based on milk, not water-based, and the texture became softer and more luxurious. I'm sure you'll love Korea after eating this.
Maybe shaved ice is already a dessert in some countries. But shaved ice in Korea is a little different. I believe it will make your day that you will never forget.

What is your purpose of visiting Korea?
There are many purposes, but I hope one of them is food. The concern is that not all Korean restaurants are recommended.
Koreans are quite sneaky, so they often do shameful things against foreigners who do not know Korea well. It's not to show off Korea to you.
Korea just want to be fairly judged by you.
