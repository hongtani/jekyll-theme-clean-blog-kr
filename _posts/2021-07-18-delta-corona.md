# The number of new confirmed cases is soaring due to the spread of the covid-19 delta mutation in Israel, a leading country in vaccination. #

In Israel, which started vaccinating the nation with Pfizer vaccine in December last year, 5.22 million people, more than 56% of the total population (about 9.3 million), have been vaccinated until the second round. The number of new confirmed cases in Israel, which once soared to 10,000 in January, fell to single digits early last month due to the rapid vaccination, and authorities had lifted all restrictions, including wearing indoor masks.

However, the number of confirmed cases surged again as Delta mutation spread. However, because most adults were vaccinated, there were not many serious patients or deaths.

Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett told a conference on the previous day that the effects of the Pfizer vaccine are weaker than authorities hope. "I don't know exactly how helpful the vaccine is, but it's very weak."


## The Pfizer vaccine's preventive efficacy has dropped to 64% since the spread of delta mutation. ##

Israeli authorities are nervous as more than half of the new confirmed cases and about 60% of severe patients have been confirmed as "breakthrough infections" cases that have been vaccinated up to the second round.

"People believe that vaccines will solve the problem completely, but they do not. "Vaccines are effective in preventing covid-19, but vaccines are not enough at a time when delta mutations are spreading rapidly around the world."

Earlier, Israel decided to vaccinate "booster shots" on a limited basis due to the spread of the virus. Israel's Ministry of Health said, "Even if the Pfizer vaccine is completed for the second time, adults with weak immune systems can immediately receive booster shots." Booster shots are aimed at patients with organ transplants or poor immunity.

It is the first time in about four months since March that the number of newly confirmed cases of Corona 19 in Israel has exceeded 1,000.

The number of severe patients also stood at 58, up eight from the 15th. Seventeen of them are in critical condition and 16 are using respirators.

Bennett stressed that the delta mutation could be completed by encouraging people to wear masks, expand vaccinations and promote social distancing instead of imposing massive blockades like his predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu.
